# PHP Starter

Basic set of files and Composer requirements for starting a PHP project.

Using Fabien Potencier's guide "Create your own framework... on top of the Symfony2 Components" as inspiration and adjusting for my own requirements and fancies along the way.

## Current Status (28/Oct/2012)

It works as a basic route-to-controller framework. Could do with a templating engine.

## TODO:

- Add template engine
- Add testing paradigm
- Add database support
- Add caching support
