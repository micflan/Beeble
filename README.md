# Beeble PHP Starter

Basic set of files and Composer requirements for starting a PHP project.

Using Fabien Potencier's guide "Create your own framework... on top of the Symfony2 Components" as inspiration and adjusting for my own requirements and fancies along the way.

## Current Status (31/Oct/2012)

It works as a very basic MVC framework, with Twig templating. Could do with some "built-in" database support.
